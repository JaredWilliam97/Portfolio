My Updated Portfolio

This is my updated portfolio in which I used all of skills that I have learned in my first 8 weeks of my class. 

In this project I am creating a the basic layout of an HTML document using CSS to style it. I have created a header, a nav bar, a main section and a footer. I used bootstrap to create my nav bar and formatted it with css and changing some styling and margin.  I have a search bar which is not in use at the time but will hopefully add some functionality in upcoming additions. 

In my nav bar I created a link to my resume, also I created a project button that will lead you to my projects and can access the url if you click on the picture.  
I have a footer that has links to my LinkedIn, Github, an email button if you wanna email me, and a couple other social media websites. 


There were some features to my website that I think will stand out. My footer I took a long time styling and trying to get it perfect.  

As I built my website I used comments to help others reading to be able to understand it better.

I started the Project doing all the HTML and after the basic layout was done I used CSS to style it.

This was a good project to add to my Portfolio. I have learned alot so far and excited to learn more!
