# Portfolio







Hello, I am new to HTML and CSS and this is my first Portfolio I have created. I will be adding more to it as I learn more. This project is to create a Portfolio using Html and CSS trying to utilize all the skills you have learned in the first week of class.

In this project I am creating a the basic layout of an HTML document using CSS to style it. I have created a header, a nav bar, a main section and a footer. In the main section I have added a few photos that describe me. I like to play hockey, and fish. I put a photo of a server room because for the past 8 years I have been a hardware server engineer.

I have created a few links in the nav bar to connect to (Github, LinkedIn.)
I have also put some links in the photo's as well.
In the footer I have my concact information along with my Github, and LinkedIn.

There were some features to my website that I think will stand out. I was able to create some hover commands in the nav bar along with a "Contact button" that stands out.

As I built my website I used comments to help others reading to be able to understand it better.

I started the Project doing all the HTML and after the basic layout was done I used CSS to style it.

This was a great start to my Portfolio. I have learned alot so far and excited to learn more!
